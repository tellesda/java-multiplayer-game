This is one of my side projects: A weird multiplayer horror game that uses tile-based graphics. Although my initial plan was to create a fun and unusual game, the project is still in its very early stages due to its time-consuming nature and my other commitments. I don't have a specific release date in mind.

Right now, the game features some silly and enjoyable elements, like an in-game computer that can run a classic game of Snake or a 3D renderer. However, some of the features I'm presenting here (maps, server UI, computer files, ...) are primarily for debugging purposes and are not meant to be included in the final version.
